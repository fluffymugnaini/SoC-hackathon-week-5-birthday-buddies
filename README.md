# BIRTHDAY BUDDIES

## The SOC brief:

`This week we would like you to build a full stack app from scratch. Put your front end HTML/JS/CSS in FrontEnd/ and create a new webapi in BackEnd/ using the dotnet cli.`

***

## Journey

We decided to build a 'Birthday Buddies' app, where you can submit your name and birthday and then see others who have birthdays in the same month. As the famous saying goes, no one wants to celebrate their birthday alone...

The backend api is built using C#, with the front end having been re-factored from an earlier JS version into React.
